# State Management in React

## Overview

State management is a crucial aspect of any application development. In React, state management allows us to manage and share data across components. There are several solutions for state management in React, including Redux, Context API, and others.

## Context API

The Context API is a built-in tool in React that allows data to be passed top-down (parent to child) via context rather than props. This makes it easier to share values between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

## Redux

Redux is an open-source library that provides a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. Redux is great for managing large chunks of data and handling requests to APIs.
